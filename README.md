# Learn React

A guided tutorial to teach the basics of modern web app development with ReactJs. You'll have a multi-page React app hosted on Github by the end of the tutorial. Here's an [example](https://miriamt.github.io/mcon-353-demo-site/).

This repo is structured as a series of sequential "session" files. Each file starts by introducing new concepts in web development or React and ends with a hands-on assignment for you to build the next part of your demo app.

This material is used by the Author as a basis for teaching the Practicum in Software Development course in Touro University. I hope you find it useful too!
