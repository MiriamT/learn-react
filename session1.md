## Install Web Development Software
### 1.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Once installed, open the Visual Studio Code editor and add the following plugins: 
- Prettier – Code formatter
- GitLens – Git supercharged

### 2.  Install ZSH and the [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) terminal (optional)

- On [Mac](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki)
- On [Windows](https://dev.to/vsalbuq/how-to-install-oh-my-zsh-on-windows-10-home-edition-49g2)

### 3.  Install [NodeJS v16 ](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Note: you might have done this as part of installing ZSH.

Check that you have the correct version installed:
> node -v  

It should print `v16.x.x`.


### 4.  Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 

Note: you might have done this as part of installing ZSH.

Check that you have the correct version installed:
> git --version

It should print `v2.x.x`.

## Create a new React application

Use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to create a new React app called demo-app:
> npx create-react-app demo-app

> cd demo-app

> npm start

After installing the new app and running the start command, your new web application should open at `localhost:3000`.
